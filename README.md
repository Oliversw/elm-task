## Screenshots

## Packages used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for creating React boilerplate code
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for sidebar icons

## Known bugs and issues

- Sidebar does not currently highlight the selected page as it is not connected to a navigation system
- Data used to render the menu options was created by me and therefore not necessarily representative of the data used in production
- Clicking outside of the sidebar does not currently close it
